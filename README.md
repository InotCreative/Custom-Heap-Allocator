Project Overview
This project involves developing a custom heap allocator in C as part of an experimental exploration into dynamic memory management techniques. The allocator is designed to handle memory allocation and deallocation with a focus on efficiency, thread safety, and performance.

Features
Custom-Sized Memory Blocks: Supports varying block sizes to optimize memory utilization and reduce fragmentation.
Memory Pool Implementation: Pre-allocates a memory pool, enabling more efficient management of memory resources.
Tracking Allocated and Free Blocks: Implements a tracking system to monitor allocated and free blocks, ensuring efficient memory management.
Thread Safety: Includes locking mechanisms to maintain correct operation in multithreaded environments.
Performance Considerations: Balances low latency and high throughput to maintain allocator performance.
Tech Stack
Programming Language: C
Platform: Embedded Systems (where applicable)
Timeline
Development Duration: 2-3 months
Actionable Steps
Develop edge detection algorithm.
Implement and test with hardware.
Iterate and finalize.
